# Computer-Vision
CV Algorithms 

This folder is a collection of matlab programs in Computer Vision. Much of the code was developed by the author (Mr. Omkar P. Waghmare) during his time at University of Michigan Ann Arbor .Some of the files depend on some models or other mfiles but that is obvious and can easily be modified by other user. Specific areas have been masked in the code by the author where users can make changer to use this code for their purpose.
Here is a list of Codes present in the file and details about them:
1) Lane_Detection_feature_based.m -->  Feature Based Lane Detection Algorithm 
2) lane_1.jpg --> Test Image for program "Lane_Detection_feature_based.m"
3) lane_2.jpeg --> Test Image for program "Lane_Detection_feature_based.m"
